# Simple Countdown Timer

This is a countdown timer for use in decorative screens. I'm tired of the ugly coundown timers I see when I try to look for one on Google. This one pretty much just does counting down, no extra features.

Also, I hacked this together over a Friday evening and a Sunday morning, and I'm usually a backend programmer. Therefore, this code probably sucks, so be warned.
